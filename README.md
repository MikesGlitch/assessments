# What is this?

This repository is a holding pen for interview assessments that I've completed. 

My goal is to provide information on my abilities without duplicating effort.


# Interview assessments can be very boring!

I encourage you to look at my personal projects as well!    They are much more interesting.

My personal projects are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/MikesGlitch).
